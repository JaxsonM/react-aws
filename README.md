# React AWS Music Stats & Movie Recommendations

Welcome to the React AWS Music Stats & Movie Recommendations application, a versatile platform that integrates Spotify music statistics with social movie recommendation features. This application serves as a live demonstration of a fully functional web application, accessible [here](https://main.d14s29q0cstol4.amplifyapp.com/).

## Features

- **Spotify Music Stats**: Users can connect with Spotify to retrieve and display detailed statistics about their top music preferences.
- **Movie Recommendations**: Leverages the OMDB API to enable users to search, select, and recommend movies to friends within the application.
- **Social Connectivity**: Incorporates a friends system allowing users to connect and share insights and recommendations effortlessly.
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes AWS Amplify for seamless updates and synchronization across user interactions.

## Purpose and Learning

This project was initiated as a hands-on approach to deepen my understanding of AWS services, including deployment and hosting. The goal was to explore how these services can be integrated into a full-stack application while providing a live platform to demonstrate these capabilities. It serves as a practical application to showcase my skills and is continuously evolving as I implement new features and improvements.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: To create interactive UI components.
- **AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito**: For backend services, authentication, and hosting.
- **Vite**: As a modern frontend build tool.
- **Axios**: For API requests to external services like Spotify and OMDB.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaxsonM/react-aws
cd react-aws
npm install
```

2. **Local development:**

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment

Deployed using AWS Amplify, this application benefits from continuous integration and delivery, updating live as changes are pushed to the repository.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a work in progress, and I plan to continue refining its features and expanding its functionality. Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
